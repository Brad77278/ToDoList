ToDoList Web App

A simple to-do-list web page where users can add and delete tasks from their list.

Written in Javascript, NodeJS, EJS, and MongoDB for the database.

New lists can be created by appending the list title at the end of the url.

For example "/Work" or "/School"

Each new list is saved to MongoDB and returned to at any time.


Enjoy!
